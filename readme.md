> Table Contest 2022 - RMarkdown Dashboard

I will participate in the RStudio/Posit Table Contest: 2022 Edition with the following FIFA22 RMarkdown App. This contest will help us to showcase the potential of standalone RMarkdown analytical dashboards (without server-side computations!!). I have employed some interesting functions from HTML+SCSS+JS and interactive visualization libraries of R. For further information, please visit the following link: (https://posit-fifa22.netlify.app/). Your feedback is highly appreciated and will help me to improve further. 

RShiny has been successfully applied to many sports analytics dashboards. However, there has not been much application of standalone RMarkdown dashboards in sports analytics, though RMarkdown is generally used for PDF/simple HTML report generations. 

This provides us an opportunity to explore FIFA22 data resources with the use of suitable visualization techniques to gain insight into the evaluation of player and team analytics.

Kaggle made a comprehensive dataset for FIFA22 publicly available, which contains detailed statistics for all players involved in each match. 

Complex nature of soccer games, it is difficult to decide upon a suitable set of attributes that can be used to evaluate an individual player’s performance. These analytics dashboards enable the coach, players, and the managers to objectively assess and thereby improve their performance. 

##### Objectives of this work

 - Find out most important attributes of player’s skillset which determine their value and wages
 - Compare the skillsets of two competing players/teams
 - Correlation analytics of player performance metrics.
 - Network maps for player transfers between clubs
  
Here we attempt to figure out the best ways to aggregate our DataViz pages so that it results in a set of storylines such that these player/team performances define the insights as much as possible.
